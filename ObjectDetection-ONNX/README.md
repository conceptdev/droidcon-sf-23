# Object Detection ONNX

This object detection sample uses the Yolov8n model, including pre- and post-processing, so it can be fed image bytes directly without a lot of boilerplate code.

The model file 12Mb - instructions to generate the model are available on the [onnxruntime-extensions repo](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-extensions/blob/main/tutorials/yolo_e2e.py#L37).
