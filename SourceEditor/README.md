# SourceEditor (with OpenAI ðŸ’¡)

This sample contains a Kotlin application designed for foldable Android devices. The application is an HTML editor that enables real-time rendering of formatted source code. Making use of the [dual view](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#dual-view) app pattern, users are able to edit and preview any changes simultaneously without switching windows.

## Incorporating OpenAI

The idea to do text processing with OpenAI comes from Syncfusion's blog post
on [integrating ChatGPT with Blazor editor in .NET](https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/integrate-chatgpt-blazor-rich-text-editor.aspx)
and [SyncfusionExamples GitHub repo](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/Integrating-OpenAI-with-Blazor-RichTextEditor).

The first pass of porting the REST API code from C# to Kotlin was itself suggested by ChatGPT.

> **NOTE:** in **Constants.kt** add your [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) key in the field `OPENAI_KEY`

OpenAI examples in this app:

### Completions endpoint

The completions endpoint behaves like the ChatGPT test form - the entire "prompt" is treated as input and the resulting text is returned. It is used in the example to implement the "summarize" feature since the source text changes significantly. This style of interaction seems more susceptible to prompt injection 'attacks'.

### Edits endpoint

The edits endpoint has two parameters: input and prompt. The "input" text is our source, and the "prompt" is the instruction - in this case to perform spell and grammar checking. The intent of this endpoint is to modify ('edit') the input wihtout significantly changing it.

### Undo

To make it easier to play with the ChatGPT endpoints, there is a simple "undo" feature added which ONLY restores the text to the previous state before either of the ChatGPT endpoint actions.

## Features

This project makes use of Jetpack [Window Manager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window) to handle events that require consideration of a hinge or fold in the device's screen.

This project also uses [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments), one to display a code editing window and another to render and display formatted code through a [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView). The app starts in single screen mode, but can be spanned to enable dual screen mode. See the Getting Started section above for more information about spanning.

### Mirrored Scrolling

If more content exists than can be displayed on the screen at once, users can scroll to view hidden content. In dual screen mode, scrolling of one screen (either editor or preview) will be mirrored on the other screen to ensure the user is always looking at relevant content.

### File Saving

To save any changes made in the editor, the save icon in the top toolbar can be pressed. The user will then be brought to a prompt where they can enter a title and location.

### File Selection

To choose a new file to open, the folder icon in the top toolbar can be pressed. A prompt will then open where the user can choose which file they want to select.

### Drag and Drop

This project also supports drag and drop functionality. If a file gallery is open in one screen, text files can be dragged into the Source Editor application. Dropping a file onto the editor or preview screen will import the file's text into the application.

## Icons

SVG for icons from [material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/android/action/lightbulb/materialicons/black/res/drawable/baseline_lightbulb_24.xml). Search the [Material icons font](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons) for useful images.
